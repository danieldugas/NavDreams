# Example Workflow: Testing Dream Error

### Install

[this install script](install_dependencies.sh) is an example of how to get the necessary dependencies,
as well as pydreamer and NavDreams in development mode

### Download data
Download the [navdreams_data](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/17_o7jPLKKlRbgySIOxn6-Z1kUHcOgld5?usp=sharing)
folder to your home directory so that `~/navdreams_data/wm_experiments` is a valid location.

### Run The Dream Error Script

In test_n_step dream, dream sequences are generated by world-models, and then compared using pixel-wise error,
as well as plotted for visualization.

First, make sure you source the virtualenv
```
source ~/n3denv/bin/activate
cd ~/Code/NavDreams
```

Now you should be able to run the evaluation script
```
python test_n_step_dream.py
```
